# Take input from the user using input function (remember the datatype of the input data)!
# For now, you can assume that input wil only be numbers, there will be no character input.

# Initializing temporary variables to store intermediate data might be useful!

# Remember to keep track of sums of alternate digits starting from the end!
# Make sure you account for the case where the product of a digit might exceed 10!

# Check the different length and numeric constraints for each individual card type!
# And finally, don't forget to account for invalid card numbers!

# Last step, print the card type using the print function.
# You can just print the card type in all caps, for example, INVALID or AMEX or VISA or MASTERCARD
